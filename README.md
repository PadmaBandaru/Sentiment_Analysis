# Sentiment_Analysis
This sentiment analysis code uses the TextBlob library and Naive Bayes classifier. It trains a model on sample text data with positive and negative labels. It then classifies new sentences, such as "The project is boring" and "I enjoy solving problems," predicting their sentiment as positive or negative based on the trained model.
